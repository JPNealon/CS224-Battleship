# CPSC 224 Final Project: Battleship

### Project Description:
The objective of this project is to develop a program to run the game Battleship. The game will have two players play
against each other on a 10x10 game board. Each player will have 5 ships: one carrier (size 5), one battleship (size 4), one destroyer (size 3), one submarine (size 2), and one boat (size 2). The ships will be placed on the game board and each player will take turns guessing where the opposing player's ships are. Each player will take turns selecting coordinates to attack. If the player's guess hits one of the opposing player's ships, the coordinate square will be marked with an 'X'. If the attack misses, the coordinate square will be marked with an 'O'. A battleship is sunk when there is an 'X' on every coordinate square that the ship occupies. The game will continue until one player has sunk all of the opposing player's ships. At the end of the game, the winner will be displayed and the option to play again will be given to the user. The game will be made using the java programming language and utilize git and github for collaborative file sharing.
